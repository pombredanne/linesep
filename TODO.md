- Use Appveyor <https://packaging.python.org/appveyor/>

- Documentation:
    - Create a Readthedocs site?
    - Add notes about potential pitfalls with regexes ("The only truly
      foolproof way to split on regexes is to read the whole file into memory
      and use the `split_*` functions")
    - Point out in the docstrings that the `read_*` functions read the files
      piecemeal rather than reading them entirely into memory?
    - Add examples to the README showing regexes, writing, joining, & splitting
    - Point out somewhere that the bytes/text nature of the input must match
      that of the separator

- Write more tests:
    - Make the `read_*` and `write_*` tests operate on actual files
    - Test splitting the same input with different `size` values (both prime
      and highly divisible)
    - Test empty separator?
    - Test splitting a Unicode string on one of the bytes in its UTF-8 encoding
    - Test text containing Unicode
    - Test bytes containing Unicode


New Features
------------
- Add a convenience function for reading/splitting on `\r\n?|\n`?
- Add a `read_paragraphs` function that treats two or more consecutive empty
  lines as a delimiter
- Add functions for creating codecs that convert between `\n` and given
  separators? (cf. `io.IncrementalNewlineDecoder`)
- Give the `read_*` functions arguments for only accepting regex matches with
  certain buffers/surroundings?
- idea: Reorganize the functions into three submodules — `separated`,
  `terminated`, and `preceded` — that each contain functions named `read`,
  `write`, `join`, and `split`
